C++ project
Our goal is to make an application which allows users to search and filter out different space missions throughout the period of 1952 to 2020.
1.	Dataset
a.	Contains information about 4324 space missions by different organizations around the globe 
b.	Main parameters are company name, location, datum, detail, status, rocket and status of the mission
c.	https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957
2.	Main features of the application (with hope) 
a.	Search bar
b.	Filtering system 
c.	Output table with suitable missions
d.	Further window with main information about the mission
e.	Global stats with graph
3.	Extra features (big MB remark)
a.	More information about the organization or maybe the cycle of missions, for example link to the Wikipedia page about all Soyuz missions
b.	We really liked the idea of Nikitaâ€™s team about generating pictures, but not so sure if we capable of doing so
4.	Functionality of the search
a.	Basic search bar
b.	Filtering system based on (could be presented as a list or slider, not so sure about it yet):
i.	The time of the mission
ii.	Location
iii.	Status
iv.	Organization 
c.	Sorting 
d.	Extra window with more information
i.	Mb, the description of the mission from Wikipedia and the link to it
ii.	Main stats in prettier output 
iii.	Generated picture 
e.	Graph, representing missions 
5.	General plan
a.	Implement all the ambitious ideas through code
b.	Qt project 
c.	GitHub stuff
d.	Success
